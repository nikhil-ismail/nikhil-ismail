# Nikhil Ismail

ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm a junior studying Computer Science at Yale University with demonstrated experience in software engineering and a particular interest in entrepreneurship, social networks, and e-commerce.

Previously, I've worked at Microsoft on the Azure Files team, <a href="https://www.courier.com/" target="_blank">Courier</a> (YC S19), and <a href="https://hauskey.com/" target="_blank">HaÃ¼skey</a> as a software engineer intern.

I am always open to connect and expand my network so feel free to reach out at nikhil.ismail@yale.edu
