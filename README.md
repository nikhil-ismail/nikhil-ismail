# Nikhil Ismail

👋 Hey! I'm a rising junior studying Computer Science at Yale University with demonstrated experience in software engineering and a particular interest in entrepreneurship, social networks, and e-commerce. This summer, I'll be interning at <a href="https://www.courier.com/" target="_blank">Courier</a> (YC S19) as a software engineer.

Previously, I've worked as a full stack developer intern at <a href="https://hauskey.com/" target="_blank">Haüskey</a>.

I am always open to connect and expand my network so feel free to reach out at nikhil.ismail@yale.edu
